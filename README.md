Diabetes Prediction using SVM

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

About

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early detection of diabetes.
It uses:

PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset for training

Support Vector Machine (SVM) for prediction

Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy) for backend processing

Streamlit for frontend user interaction

Users can input medical details such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, age, etc., and the app instantly provides a prediction with a confidence score.

Setup

Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:

streamlit run app.py

Deployment

This app can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud for demonstration purposes.
